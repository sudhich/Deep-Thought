Here are some of the key functionalities and things that Transformers can do:\n","\n","1. **Pre-trained Models**: Transformers provides access to a wide range of pre-trained transformer-based models. These models are trained on massive datasets and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks. You can easily load these pre-trained models and use them for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, translation, text generation, and more.\n","\n","2. **Fine-tuning**: Transformers allows you to fine-tune pre-trained models on your own datasets. This is particularly useful when you have a specific NLP task that you want to solve, and you can adapt a pre-trained model to perform well on your task with relatively little data and effort.\n","\n","3. **Tokenization**: The library includes tokenizers for various transformer-based models. Tokenization is a crucial step in preparing text data for input into these models, and Transformers makes it easy to tokenize text efficiently.\n","\n","4. **Inference and Generation**: You can use Transformers to generate text and perform inference with your fine-tuned models. This is useful for tasks like chatbots, text completion, and text summarization.\n","\n","5. **Model Architecture**: Transformers provides detailed information about the architecture of transformer models. You can inspect the layers, weights, and parameters of these models, which is valuable for researchers and developers who want to understand and customize model behavior.\n","\n","6. **Model Hub**: Transformers is integrated with Hugging Face's Model Hub, where you can find a wide variety of pre-trained models, model checkpoints, and resources shared by the NLP community. It makes it easy to discover, download, and use models for different tasks.\n","\n","7. **Datasets**: Transformers can be used in conjunction with Hugging Face's Datasets library, which offers a vast collection of NLP datasets for various tasks. You can seamlessly load and preprocess these datasets for training and evaluation.\n","\n","8. **Model Deployment**: While Transformers primarily focuses on model development and experimentation, it can also be used as a starting point for deploying NLP models in production systems.\n","\n","9. **Multi-lingual Support**: Many of the pre-trained models available in Transformers support multiple languages, making it valuable for multilingual applications.\n","\n","In summary, Transformers is a comprehensive library that simplifies working with transformer-based models in NLP and AI tasks. It abstracts many of the complexities associated with these models, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers for various natural language processing tasks."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"QDR95S-PXOr-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4sTvYUUNlrVC"},"source":["Hugging Face is a company and open-source community that specializes in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI).

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$226 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $249 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.[4][5][6]\n","\n","Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\n","\n","In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\n","\n","Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including that of spreading COVID-19 misinformation, and promoting conspiracy theories. His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform and changes to Twitter Blue verification were criticized. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\n","\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14533,"status":"ok","timestamp":1694794788468,"user":{"displayName":"SUDHIRAM CHAUHAN","userId":"02596154268242543486"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"00-wFpzYgnnX","outputId":"3f0dcb3a-f2f0-4ba9-c966-33024e762d37"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 and revision a4f8f3e (https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6).\n","Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.\n"]}],"source":["summarizer = pipeline('summarization')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":18934,"status":"ok","timestamp":1694794889789,"user":{"displayName":"SUDHIRAM CHAUHAN","userId":"02596154268242543486"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"nNYwd8RhgnwO","outputId":"7fce5652-08ce-4d3b-c6a8-1e47fe66b2c3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[" Elon Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX.
